# Full-Stack JavaScript MERN

## About

The MERN stack is website development from front-end to back-end using one programming language, Javascript. MERN stands for Several Powerful Development Technologies.
M for MongoDB (database). E for Express (framework). R for ReactJS (FE). N for NextJS (FE) and NodeJS (core BE).

In this class, will create a complex project in the form of a top up game website. The material starts from the FE side, including changing the HTML design template that we have been slicing into NextJS. In order to easily manage large-scale data, component libraries will be organized according to Atomic Design principles. On the BE side, the main NodeJS framework is used for routing, middleware, database integration to testing. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) will also be used to organize database content as needed. Then API integration is implemented on both sides to enable data access on the same server. 


## Key Point

- Deploying projects to Vercel (Front-End) and Heroku (Back-End)
- Integrating NodeJS REST API with ReactJS (NextJS)
- Create Sign Up and Sign In features
- Create a CRUD that includes logging in with JWT
- Create a Storybook to build component libraries in React
- Working with databases MongoDB
- Convert HTML to NextJS
- Understand website development as a whole (Front-End and Back-End)
